            <p>
                Is specifically designed to be a luxury Megacar alternative to Koenigsegg’s traditional extreme, light weight, race-like road cars.

The Koenigsegg Regera combines a powerful twin-turbo V8 combustion engine with three electric motors and cutting edge battery power via new powertrain technology called Koenigsegg Direct Drive.<br> This revolutionary technology removes the traditional gearbox, making the car lighter and more efficient.

            <h2>The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut</h2>
            <img src="absolut.jpg">
            <p>
                The Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut has been unveiled. It is the fastest Koenigsegg ever made and the company will never endeavor to make a faster series-production road car – ever. Customers will be able to choose between the Jesko Absolut and the more track-oriented Jesko version that was presented a year ago.

Every surface element on the Jesko Absolut has been purposefully constructed to reduce drag or surrounding turbulence around the car while increasing high-speed stability. Although just as powerful, the Jesko Absolut is a more seamless and stealthier interpretation of the Jesko, its track-focused sibling.

            <p>
                Ultimate performance has belonged to the world of two-seaters with very limited luggage space – until now. The Gemera is the world’s first Mega-GT and Koenigsegg’s first four-seater. Extreme megacar meets spacious interior and ultimate environmental consciousness.
